# DATA_ANALYSIS_ON-Particle-Identification-from-Detector-Responses
The dataset has four particle types identified by six detector signals. It is imbalanced with some zero values due to detector issues. Features are uncorrelated and show distinct patterns. PCA confirms useful structure, making it suitable for classification with proper preprocessing.
