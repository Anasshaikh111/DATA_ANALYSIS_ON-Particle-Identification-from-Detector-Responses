# DATA_ANALYSIS_ON-Particle-Identification-from-Detector-Responses
The dataset has four particle types identified by six detector signals. It is imbalanced with some zero values due to detector issues. Features are uncorrelated and show distinct patterns. PCA confirms useful structure, making it suitable for classification with proper preprocessing.    

# Particle Identification from Detector Responses

##  Abstract
This project focuses on identifying four types of particles—positron, pion, kaon, and proton—based on six detector signals. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, we explore the dataset's characteristics, address its challenges, and assess its suitability for supervised learning.

##  Introduction
Particle detectors produce multiple signals for each particle detected during high-energy physics experiments. This project analyzes these signals to differentiate between four particles using classical data analysis methods. Challenges such as class imbalance, missing values, and feature correlation are addressed.

##  Methodology Used for Data Analysis
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Checked for missing/null values
   - Replaced or handled zero values

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Used histograms, pair plots, and count plots to visualize distributions and class imbalances.

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Checked feature correlation to ensure independent signal contribution.

4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization to check separability of particle types.

5. **Classification (Optional)**
   - Preliminary classification using Random Forest (interrupted due to computational limits).

##  Conclusions and Results
The dataset, though imbalanced and containing zero values, has distinct feature patterns across particle types. Detector responses are largely uncorrelated, contributing unique information. PCA visualization reveals observable clustering, confirming the dataset’s suitability for classification. However, careful preprocessing like class balancing and scaling is essential for accurate modeling.
